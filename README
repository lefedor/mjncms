MjNCMS - Mojolicious-[PERL]-based CMS [Mj Not CMS :) ]

Project goal is not create CMS, but create ``CMS`` enviropment.
Let me describe: every time you start new project you need 
mess with "boring" stuff. Like user model, categories, 
static pages, html block u/content_manager can change over web ui, 
make admin panel, other simple and not stuff.
This always takes time - you have idea, but days/weeks later 
you (pssoble :)) still mess with them and `core functional` 
as is "far far away" as they were some time ago.
I meet same problem - my "framework/kitchen" 
(CGI.pm/Template-Toolkit) was not modern at all.
I've desided build new useful env based on some 
mainstream framework form 0, but with couple things in mind.
And Mojo/Mojolicious becomes decision.

So this is first public "*yehay it's working*" realise :).
